Hello, NEAR
==================

This APP is designed as a demonstration of basic greeting smart contract.
Demo is available at https://21horza.github.io/hello_near/


===========


Exploring The Code
==================

1. The "backend" code lives in the `/contract` folder. See the README there for
   more info.
2. The frontend code lives in the `/src` folder. `/src/index.html` is a great
   place to start exploring. Note that it loads in `/src/index.js`, where you
   can learn how the frontend connects to the NEAR blockchain.
3. Tests: there are different kinds of tests for the frontend and the smart
   contract. See `contract/README` for info about how it's tested. The frontend
   code gets tested with [jest]. You can run both of these at once with `yarn
   run test`.

How to use
==================
